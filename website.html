            <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
                <p> 
                    Even if the world mass-produces quantities of food, more than sufficient to feed everyone on Earth, it is said that up to 783 million people
                    still starve even with the technology and facilities we have now. Factors that may be contributing to food insecurity—which is defined or is
                    more well known as the low accessibility of safe and healthy food in order to sustain a healthy life—are the following: poverty, environmental degradation,
                    or conflict between countries. <br> Despite knowing these unfortunate circumstances, many take the food served to them for granted since the majority are
                    financially capable of buying basic needs like food. This leads to normalizing improper practices involving food such as not eating what's on the dining table or
                    throwing away leftovers that hasn't expired. People tend to forget that there are some who haven't eaten in days or even weeks! Which brings to the reason why this
                    website aims to bring light to a current social issue, world hunger.
